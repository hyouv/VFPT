Official implementation of NeurIPS 2024 "Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning"

I am currently organizing the code and will make it publicly available no later than the NeurIPS 2024 conference. 

If you urgently need access to the code, please feel free to contact me (rz4545@rit.edu), and I will promptly provide you with the original version.

Thank you for your understanding and patience!
